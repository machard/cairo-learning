# What is it

A simple pool where anyone can deposit/withdraw any token.
Anyone can flashloan deposited token for a small price.

# TODO:

- use SafeUint256
- redistribute profit to depositors at the end of flashloan method
- use a variable flashloan price
- add more test scenarios (specifically failing scenarios)
- check usage of locals
